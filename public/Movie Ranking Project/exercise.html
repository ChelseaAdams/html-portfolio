    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite movie of all time. Hans Zimmer's score complements the theme of suspense and danger in high-stakes space travel so well. I annoy all of my friends and family to watch this movie.</p>
    <h3>James Cameron's Avatar</h3>
    <p>The first time I saw this movie was in theaters with my best friend Josh. I was a bit of a young movie critic at the time because my parents watched a lot of movies. So I had developed my own subjective evaluation system to determine whether or not a movie had earned my hoity approval. I couldn't tell you the criteria by which I measured movies, but it was entirely subjective and superficial. Many movies didn't pass because I could usually find something wrong with the flow or a disruption in the integrity of the way an actor portrayed their charachter, however Avatar passed with flying colors. I was absolutely speechless afterward and stomped out of the theater right as the credits started rolling. I nearly didn't talk on the whole drive home. Josh assumed that I disliked the movie due to my silence and extreme behavior, but I had actually been so moved I was incapable of conversation.</p>
    <h3>Vampire Hunter D</h3>
    <p>This anime is one of the most visually appealing works I've ever seen. I was introduced to this anime in middle or high school by my step-father and I'm forever thankful for having been exposed to the solemn and laconic protagonist D, the bounty-hunting half-vampire son of Dracula. The setting of the anime is in a medieval-futuristic crossover in which the supernatural and the cybernetic coincide in the same bleak universe.</p>
